# Connect Four

Four In A Row game is a classic strategy game in which 2 players go head-to-head in a battle to own the grid! Players have discs, which they drop into the grid, starting in the middle or at the edge to stack their colored discs upwards, horizontally, or diagonally. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. The first player to connect four of their discs wins the game.
